            <a id="whoAreWeText">We are a Hackathon team based in Washington that frequently participates in local hackathons. Our team consists of friends from different schools who all have a passion for computer science and are always up to the challenge of a hackathon. <br><br> Although Washington is known for its competitivness and high-programming skill level, our skills have landed us high places and prizes in a few hackathons which we participated in. We have shown that we can consistently win awards and get earnings.</a>
